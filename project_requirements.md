**Project Requirements: Time Logging System**

The goal is to develop a lightweight and user-friendly time logging system for multiple users. The system will primarily allow users to create tasks and log time against these tasks. A straightforward export functionality is also needed for generating timesheets, which can be used for reporting purposes. Given the simplicity of the requirement, SQLite is considered as the database backend, but the system should run off a simple Node.js server or similar. The final solution should be maintainable by developers who may not have specialized expertise in advanced front-end frameworks.

### Key Requirements

1. **User Management**
   - Ability to create user accounts and manage user data.
   - Users should have unique credentials to log in to the system.

2. **Task Management**
   - Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Each task should include fields such as title, description, and optional due date.

3. **Time Logging**
   - Users can log multiple time entries for each task.
   - Time entries should include start time, end time, and optional notes.
   - Allow users to view and edit logged time.

4. **Data Export**
   - Provide functionality to export timesheets in CSV or Excel format.
   - Option to export individual users' timesheets for a specific time period.
   - Option to export timesheets for multiple users within a specific time period.

5. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: Node.js server (using Express or similar lightweight framework).
   - Database: SQLite for simplicity and easy deployment.
   - Frontend: Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript to keep the UI simple and easy to maintain.
   - Optional: Consider using lightweight libraries like EJS for templating or Vue.js if minor reactivity is desired without adding significant complexity.

6. **User Interface**
   - User-friendly, minimalist UI to create and manage tasks and log time.
   - Dashboard for users to view tasks and corresponding time logs.

7. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Ability to view time logged per user and per task.
   - Simple reporting page that summarizes hours worked within a selected time range.

8. **Authentication**
   - Basic authentication mechanism (e.g., session-based or token-based).
   - Consider using libraries like Passport.js for easy integration.

9. **Deployment**
   - The system should be deployable on a local server or cloud instance with minimal configuration.
   - Should be lightweight to ensure it runs smoothly even on low-resource environments.

10. **Extensibility**
    - Code should be modular to allow future developers to add features easily.
    - Documentation on how to extend and modify key parts of the system should be provided.

### Optional Features (Future Considerations)

- **Tagging System**: Allow users to add tags to tasks for better organization.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A separate interface for managing users and reviewing overall time logs.
- **Notifications**: Basic email notifications to remind users of overdue tasks or unlogged hours.
- **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with a cloud database if the need arises to scale beyond SQLite.

### Deliverables
- **Time Logging System**: Fully functional application meeting the key requirements above.
- **Documentation**: Developer and user documentation for easy setup, use, and modification.
- **Codebase**: Clear, commented code suitable for future modification by developers without specialized frontend expertise.
